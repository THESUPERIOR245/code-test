Certainly! Here's a simple Python coding sample that demonstrates how to find the sum of all even numbers in a list:

python
Copy code
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    even_sum = 0
    for number in numbers:
        if number % 2 == 0:
            even_sum += number
    return even_sum

# Test the function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
result = sum_even_numbers(numbers)
print(f"The sum of even numbers in the list is: {result}")
